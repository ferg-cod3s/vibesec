## 🗣️ Using Plain Language Mode

**Best for non-technical users!**

```bash
vibesec scan --explain
```

### What Changes?

Instead of technical jargon like "CWE-798" or "SQL Injection", you'll see:

✅ **Clear explanations** in everyday language
✅ **Real-world analogies** (e.g., "like leaving your door unlocked")
✅ **Time estimates** for each fix (e.g., "15-30 minutes")
✅ **Who can fix it** (e.g., "Any developer" or "Backend developer")
✅ **Security score** out of 100

### Example Plain Language Output

```
🚨 [1] Urgent - Fix Today

Found:
Hardcoded API Key Detected in config/database.js:9

What this means:
API keys should be stored in environment variables, not hardcoded in source code.
Exposed credentials can be used by attackers to access your API.

Think of this like having a password written on a sticky note on your monitor.

Why it matters:
High risk of data breach, legal liability, and financial loss

If this code is shared (GitHub, email, etc.), anyone who sees it can:
  • Use your API keys and credentials
  • Rack up charges on your accounts
  • Access your private data

How to fix:
Move the API key to an environment variable using process.env or equivalent

Practical details:
• Time needed: 10-15 minutes
• Who can fix: Any developer
• Priority: immediately
```

## 📊 Understanding Your Security Score

When you use `--explain`, you'll see a security score:

```
Security Score:
  85/100 (B) - Good
  Your score is 5 points above the average for small projects (avg: 80/100)
```

### What the Scores Mean

| Score | Grade | Meaning |
|-------|-------|---------|
| 98-100 | A+ | Excellent - Outstanding security |
| 90-97 | A | Very Good - Strong security posture |
| 80-89 | B | Good - Some improvements needed |
| 70-79 | C | Fair - Security needs attention |
| 60-69 | D | Poor - Significant concerns |
| 0-59 | F | Critical - Immediate action required |

### How Scores Are Calculated

VibeSec deducts points based on severity:
- **Critical issue** = -25 points
- **High issue** = -10 points
- **Medium issue** = -5 points
- **Low issue** = -2 points

**Example:** If you have 2 critical issues and 1 high issue:
- Start: 100 points
- 2 critical × 25 = -50 points
- 1 high × 10 = -10 points
- **Final score: 40/100 (F)**

## 📈 Generating Stakeholder Reports

Need to present security status to your boss, board, or investors?

### Generate Executive Report

```bash
vibesec scan -f stakeholder -o security-report.txt
```

This creates a board-ready report with:
- ✅ Executive summary
- ✅ Security score with benchmark
- ✅ Risk assessment (HIGH/MODERATE/LOW)
- ✅ Business impact analysis
- ✅ Remediation cost estimates
- ✅ No technical jargon

### What the Report Looks Like

```

## 🎨 Accessibility Features

### Disable Colors

Some terminals don't support colors well, or you may be using a screen reader.

```bash
# Option 1: Use the flag
vibesec scan --no-color

# Option 2: Set environment variable
NO_COLOR=1 vibesec scan .
```

This removes all color codes, making output friendly for:
- Screen readers
- Terminals without color support
- Screen recording tools
- Copy/paste into documentation

---

## 🔧 Common Scanning Options

vibesec scan --severity high

# Show everything (default)
vibesec scan --severity low
```

### Save Output to File

```bash
# Plain text report
vibesec scan -o report.txt

# JSON format (for tooling)
vibesec scan -f json -o report.json

   - Hardcoded secrets
   - SQL injection
   - Command injection

2. **High (⚠️)** - Fix THIS WEEK
   - XSS vulnerabilities
   - Insecure authentication
   - CORS misconfigurations

3. **Medium (📋)** - Fix THIS MONTH
   - Missing rate limiting

# Share the file with your developer
# They'll see exactly what to fix and how
```

### Step 3: Verify Fixes

After your developer makes changes:

```bash
vibesec scan --explain

# You should see:
# ✅ Fewer issues
# ✅ Higher security score

## 💡 Real-World Examples

### Example 1: PM Checking AI-Generated Code

**Scenario:** Your AI tool generated a user registration endpoint. Is it secure?

```bash
# Scan the generated code
vibesec scan src/auth --explain

# Look for:
# 🚨 Hardcoded passwords or keys
# ⚠️ Missing input validation
# 📋 Weak authentication patterns
```

**Result:** Found 3 issues. Shared report with engineer. Fixed in 45 minutes.

### Example 2: Founder Preparing for Investor Demo

**Scenario:** Investor asks about security. You need a report.

```bash
# Generate stakeholder report
vibesec scan -f stakeholder -o investor-report.txt

# Email the report showing:
# ✅ 95/100 security score
# ✅ Only 2 low-severity issues
# ✅ 1 hour estimated fix time
```

**Result:** Investor impressed by proactive security approach.

### Example 3: Designer Checking Prototype Code

**Scenario:** You coded a simple prototype with AI help. Want to ensure it's safe before sharing.

```bash
vibesec scan prototype/ --explain

# Found issues:
# 🚨 API key exposed in code
# ⚠️ No input sanitization
```

**Action:** Fixed both issues following the "How to fix" instructions. Score improved from 40/100 to 95/100.

## 🎓 Understanding Common Issues

### Hardcoded Secrets

**What it is:** Passwords, API keys, or tokens written directly in code

**Why it matters:** Anyone with access to code can steal your credentials

**How to fix:** Use environment variables

```javascript
// ❌ BAD
const apiKey = "sk_live_1234567890";

// ✅ GOOD
const apiKey = process.env.API_KEY;
```

### SQL Injection

**What it is:** User input directly in database queries

**Why it matters:** Attackers can read/modify/delete your data

**How to fix:** Use parameterized queries

```javascript
// ❌ BAD
const query = `SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ${userId}`;

// ✅ GOOD
const query = 'SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?';
db.query(query, [userId]);
```

### XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)

**What it is:** User input displayed without sanitization

**Why it matters:** Attackers can inject malicious scripts

**How to fix:** Sanitize all user input

```javascript
// ❌ BAD
res.send(`<div>${userInput}</div>`);

// ✅ GOOD
const sanitized = escapeHtml(userInput);
res.send(`<div>${sanitized}</div>`);
```
