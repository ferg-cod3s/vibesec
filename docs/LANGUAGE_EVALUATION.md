# VibeSec MVP Language Evaluation

**Date**: 2025-10-17
**Decision Point**: Continue with Bun/TypeScript or rewrite in Go/Rust/Zig
**Context**: POC complete (2,063 lines), performance 6-12x slower than target
**Documentation Source**: Context7 MCP (latest as of 2025-10-17)

## Executive Summary

**Recommendation**: **Continue with Bun/TypeScript for MVP, evaluate Go rewrite post-launch**

**Reasoning**:
1. MVP timeline is critical (8 weeks to market)
2. Current Bun POC is functional with 82% test coverage
3. Premature optimization before real-world data
4. Can optimize hot paths with Bun FFI to Rust/C if needed
5. Go rewrite requires ~100+ hours (2-3 week delay)
6. Performance bottlenecks not yet identified empirically

**Key Insight**: Measure first, optimize second. Launch MVP, gather production metrics, then make data-driven decision.

## Recommendation: Staged Approach

### Phase 1: Validate Performance (Week 1, 20 hours)

**Actions**:
1. Build minimal AST parser in Bun (10 hours)
   - Tree-sitter for JavaScript/TypeScript only
   - Parse 1,000 realistic files
   - Measure time and memory

2. Build minimal AST parser in Go (10 hours)
   - Same functionality, same test files
   - Direct performance comparison

3. Compare Results (2 hours)
   - Side-by-side benchmarks
   - Extrapolate to 10K files with caching
   - Make go/no-go decision

**Decision Criteria**:
- **If Bun ≤ 250ms per file**: Continue with Bun ✅
- **If Bun 250-500ms per file**: Continue but plan Go port for v2.0
- **If Bun > 500ms per file**: Immediately switch to Go rewrite

### Phase 2A: Continue with Bun (if validation passes)

**Timeline**: Weeks 1-8 (original MVP plan)

**Actions**:
1. Complete Priority 1 in Bun (38 hours as planned)
2. Implement incremental scanning (critical for performance)
3. Optimize hot paths with profiling
4. Use Bun FFI if needed for critical sections
5. Ship MVP, gather production metrics
6. Evaluate Go rewrite post-launch based on real data

**Milestones**:
- Week 2: AST parser complete, performance validated
- Week 3: Incremental scanning working (80% speedup)
- Week 8: MVP launched

### Phase 2B: Switch to Go (if Bun validation fails)

**Timeline**: Weeks 1-11 (3-week delay acceptable)

**Actions**:
1. Port core scanner to Go (40 hours)
2. Port rules engine to Go (20 hours)
3. Port reporters to Go (20 hours)
4. Port tests to Go (20 hours)
5. Complete Priority 1 features (57 hours)
6. Ship MVP in Go

**Milestones**:
- Week 2: Go port decision finalized
- Week 5: Core port complete, tests passing
- Week 8: Priority 1 complete
- Week 11: MVP launched

## Implementation Roadmap

### Week 1: Performance Validation Sprint

**Monday-Tuesday** (16 hours):
- [ ] Set up tree-sitter in Bun (`bun add tree-sitter tree-sitter-javascript`)
- [ ] Implement basic AST parser class (scanner/analyzers/ast-parser.ts)
- [ ] Parse 1,000 test files (mix of JS/TS, varying sizes)
- [ ] Measure: parse time, memory usage, CPU usage
- [ ] Document results

**Wednesday-Thursday** (16 hours):
- [ ] Set up Go project structure
- [ ] Implement equivalent AST parser in Go (`smacker/go-tree-sitter`)
- [ ] Parse same 1,000 test files
- [ ] Measure same metrics
- [ ] Document results

**Friday** (8 hours):
- [ ] Side-by-side performance comparison
- [ ] Extrapolate to full 10K file scan with caching
- [ ] Calculate projected MVP performance
- [ ] Make go/no-go decision
- [ ] Document decision rationale
- [ ] Update GitHub Project with decision

### Week 2+: Execute Chosen Path

**If Continue with Bun**:
- Week 2-3: Complete Priority 1 (38 hours)
- Week 4-8: Execute original MVP roadmap
- Continuously monitor performance
- Have Go rewrite as "Plan B" for v2.0

**If Switch to Go**:
- Week 2-5: Port existing code to Go (100 hours)
- Week 6-8: Complete Priority 1 in Go (57 hours)
- Week 9-11: Testing, polish, launch
- Accept 3-week delay as investment in performance

## Conclusion

**Final Recommendation**: **Staged Approach (Phase 1 validation)**

1. **Week 1**: Build AST parser prototypes in both Bun and Go
2. **Week 1 Friday**: Make data-driven decision based on actual benchmarks
3. **Week 2+**: Execute chosen path (Bun or Go)

**Expected Outcome**: Bun likely passes validation with incremental scanning, but if not, Go rewrite provides solid backup plan.

**Key Success Factors**:
- Measure before optimizing
- Ship MVP fast to gather real-world data
- Keep Go rewrite as "Plan B" for post-MVP
- Focus on incremental scanning (80% speedup) regardless of language

**Timeline Impact**:
- Best case: 8 weeks (Bun passes validation)
- Acceptable case: 11 weeks (Go rewrite if needed)
- Risk mitigation: Decision made by Week 2, minimal delay
