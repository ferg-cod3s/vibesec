## User Pain Points

### Target User: Vibe Coders

**Demographics:**
- Solo founders (40%)
- Small teams 2-10 people (35%)
- PMs/designers prototyping (15%)
- Indie hackers/side projects (10%)

**Pain Points:**

1. **"I don't know if my code is secure"**
   - No security expertise
   - AI makes code look professional but may be vulnerable
   - Fear of deploying insecure code

2. **"Security tools are too technical"**
   - Can't understand SAST tool outputs
   - Don't know what CWE-798 means
   - Need plain-language explanations

3. **"I'm moving too fast to do manual reviews"**
   - Shipping multiple times per day
   - No time for comprehensive security audits
   - Need automated checks

4. **"I need to show investors we're secure"**
   - Investor due diligence requires security
   - Need compliance reports
   - Want security scores/badges

5. **"Existing tools don't catch AI-specific issues"**
   - Snyk finds dependency vulns but not AI patterns
   - Generic SAST tools miss incomplete implementations
   - No detection for prompt injection

## Competitive Landscape

### Existing Tools

#### 1. Snyk
**Focus:** Dependency vulnerability scanning
**Strengths:**
- Comprehensive CVE database
- Wide language support
- Good developer integrations

**Gaps for Vibe Coders:**
- ❌ No AI-specific pattern detection
- ❌ Technical outputs not accessible to PMs/designers
- ❌ Doesn't detect incomplete implementations or TODOs
- ❌ Expensive ($35K-$90K/year for teams)

**Pricing:** $25/month starter, $34K-$90K annually for 50-100 devs

---

#### 2. Socket.dev
**Focus:** Supply chain attack detection
**Strengths:**
- Proactive malicious package detection
- Real-time dependency monitoring
- JavaScript, Python, Go support

**Gaps for Vibe Coders:**
- ❌ Only covers dependencies, not custom code
- ❌ No AI-generated code pattern detection
- ❌ Limited help for prompt injection or data leakage

**Pricing:** Not publicly disclosed

---

#### 3. GitGuardian
**Focus:** Secrets detection in git repos
**Strengths:**
- Real-time secrets scanning
- IDE integration (VS Code)
- Machine learning for secret classification

**Gaps for Vibe Coders:**
- ❌ Reactive (after secrets are committed)
- ❌ Limited to credentials, not broader security
- ❌ No AI-specific vulnerability detection

---

#### 4. Aikido Security
**Focus:** Application security platform (code + cloud + runtime)
**Strengths:**
- Published "Vibe Coders' Security Checklist"
- Auto-remediation with PR generation
- AI-based auto-triage

**Gaps for Vibe Coders:**
- ❌ Vibe coding checklist is just a blog post, not integrated detection
- ❌ Still primarily focused on traditional app sec
- ❌ Limited AI-specific detection rules

**Market Position:** Closest competitor, but still generic app sec focus
