# VibeSec MVP Roadmap

**Version:** 1.0.0
**Timeline:** 6-8 weeks (post-POC)
**Goal:** Production-ready tool for early-stage vibe coding startups

---

## MVP Vision

Transform the POC into a **market-ready product** that vibe coders trust for securing AI-generated code before production deployment.

### Target Users (MVP)
- Solo founders using Lovable, Bolt.new, Replit
- Early-stage startups (2-10 person teams)
- Indie hackers shipping fast with AI tools
- Non-technical builders (PMs, designers) prototyping with AI

---

## MVP Feature Set

### 1. Enhanced Core Scanner ‚úÖ

**Improvements over POC:**
- Advanced AST parsing (Tree-sitter for multi-language support)
- Confidence scoring for AI-generated code detection
- Language support: JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Go
- Incremental scanning (only scan changed files)
- Performance: <2 min for 10K files

**New Capabilities:**
- Configuration file support (`.vibesec.yaml`)
- Custom rule definitions
- Severity-based CI/CD gates
- File/directory exclusion patterns

---

### 2. AI-Specific Detection Engine üÜï

**Purpose:** Detect patterns unique to AI-generated code

| Pattern | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Incomplete Implementations** | Placeholder functions with TODOs | `function auth() { /* TODO */ }` |
| **Over-permissive Configs** | Insecure defaults from AI | `cors({ origin: '*' })` |
| **Generic Error Handlers** | Exposing stack traces | `catch(e) { return e.toString() }` |
| **Missing Edge Cases** | No validation for empty/null | `const user = data.user.name` |
| **Prompt Injection Risks** | User input passed to LLM | `llm.ask(req.body.prompt)` |
| **Data Exfiltration** | Logging sensitive data | `console.log(apiKey)` |

**Detection Method:**
- Heuristic analysis (naming patterns, code structure)
- Confidence score (0.0-1.0) for "likely AI-generated"
- Rule-based pattern matching from community database

---

### 3. Integration Layer üîó

#### 3.1 Snyk Integration
**Purpose:** Enrich findings with dependency vulnerability data

**Workflow:**
```
VibeSec Scan ‚Üí Detect dependencies ‚Üí Query Snyk API
‚Üí Merge results ‚Üí Unified report
```

**Output:** Findings tagged with Snyk vulnerability IDs and severity

#### 3.2 Socket.dev Integration
**Purpose:** Supply chain attack detection

**Workflow:**
```
VibeSec Scan ‚Üí Extract package.json/requirements.txt
‚Üí Query Socket.dev ‚Üí Flag risky packages ‚Üí Report
```

**Output:** Supply chain risk score + package risk breakdown

#### 3.3 GitHub Action
**Purpose:** Automate security checks in CI/CD

**Features:**
- Scan on every PR
- Annotate code with inline comments
- Upload SARIF to GitHub Security tab
- Configurable severity thresholds for PR blocks
