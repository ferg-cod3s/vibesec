# VibeSec User Feedback Collection Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the strategy for collecting, organizing, and analyzing user feedback during Phase 4 (User Testing) of the VibeSec POC development.

## Goals

1. **Validate Comprehension**: Confirm junior developers can understand findings
2. **Assess Usability**: Verify installation and usage are straightforward
3. **Measure Accuracy**: Quantify true/false positive rates in real-world usage
4. **Identify Gaps**: Discover missing features or unclear documentation
5. **Guide Iteration**: Prioritize improvements for Phase 5

## Target Audience

### Primary Testers (Priority)
- **Junior Developers** (0-2 years experience)
  - Target: 5-10 testers
  - Rationale: Primary target audience for comprehension validation

### Secondary Testers (Valuable perspective)
- **Mid-level Developers** (2-5 years experience)
  - Target: 3-5 testers
  - Rationale: Can compare to other tools, identify workflow integration gaps

- **Security Engineers** (Optional)
  - Target: 1-2 testers
  - Rationale: Validate technical accuracy, identify false positives/negatives

## Recruitment Strategy

### Internal Recruitment
1. **Company/Team Members**
   - Reach out to development teams
   - Offer early access incentive
   - Estimated time: 15 minutes

2. **Educational Partnerships**
   - Bootcamp students/graduates
   - University CS programs
   - Online learning communities (freeCodeCamp, The Odin Project)

3. **Community Outreach**
   - Reddit: r/webdev, r/learnprogramming, r/javascript
   - Discord: Programming servers, web dev communities
   - Twitter/X: Developer hashtags (#100DaysOfCode, #DevCommunity)

### Incentives

## Data Analysis Plan

### Quantitative Metrics

**Installation Success Rate**
- Target: >90% successful installations
- Formula: (successful_installs / total_attempts) * 100

**Comprehension Score** (Avg of Q4, Q5, Q6 ratings)
- Target: >7.5/10 average
- Formula: (sum_of_ratings / num_responses) 

**Usability Score** (Avg of Q1, Q8, Q10 ratings)
- Target: >7.0/10 average

**Accuracy Metrics**
- False Positive Rate: (false_positives / total_findings) * 100
  - Target: <10%
- False Negative Rate: (missed_vulns / total_vulns) * 100
  - Target: <5%

**Performance Satisfaction**
- Scan time: % responding "Excellent" or "Good"
  - Target: >80%

**Recommendation Score** (Net Promoter Score - Q21)
- Promoters (9-10): Likely to recommend
- Passives (7-8): Neutral
- Detractors (1-6): Unlikely to recommend
- NPS = % Promoters - % Detractors
- Target: NPS > 20 (good for POC stage)

### Qualitative Analysis

**Thematic Coding** (for open-ended responses):
1. Read all responses for Q22, Q23, Q24
2. Identify recurring themes/patterns
3. Tag with categories:
   - Documentation clarity
   - Output format preferences
   - Feature requests
   - Confusion points
   - Workflow integration ideas

**Priority Matrix**:
| Impact | Effort | Priority |
|--------|--------|----------|
