# GitHub Project Search Strategy for Beta Testing

**Purpose:** Find AI-generated projects to scan with VibeSec for real-world data and beta tester outreach

**Date:** 2025-10-10

---

## üéØ Search Strategy Overview

We'll use GitHub's native search to find:
1. Projects with AI attribution (ChatGPT, Claude, Cursor mentions)
2. Recently active JavaScript/TypeScript projects
3. Individual developers (not companies) who might be open to testing

---

## üîç GitHub Search Queries

### Search 1: Projects with AI Attribution in README

**Go to:** https://github.com/search

**Query 1 - ChatGPT Projects:**
```
"generated by ChatGPT" OR "built with ChatGPT" language:JavaScript created:>2024-01-01
```

**Query 2 - Claude Projects:**
```
"built with Claude" OR "generated by Claude" language:TypeScript created:>2024-01-01
```

**Query 3 - Cursor Projects:**
```
"created with Cursor" OR "built using Cursor" language:JavaScript created:>2024-01-01
```

**Query 4 - AI Code Assistants:**

## üìä Filtering Criteria

### ‚úÖ Include Projects That:
- Have 0-50 stars (individuals, not popular tools)
- Last commit within 3 months (active development)
- Are JavaScript/TypeScript (we can scan them)
- Have package.json (Node.js projects)
- Have individual maintainer (not organizations)
- Have README with clear description

### ‚ùå Exclude Projects That:
- Are archived or inactive (>6 months no commits)
- Are company/organization repos
- Are AI tools themselves (chatbot frameworks, etc.)
- Are too large (>1000 files)
- Have no clear owner contact

---

## üéØ Target Project Profile

**Perfect Target:**
- **Size:** 10-100 files
- **Language:** JavaScript or TypeScript
- **Last Commit:** Within last month
- **Stars:** 0-20 (personal project)
- **Owner:** Individual developer, active on GitHub
- **Type:** Web app, API, or tool
- **AI Attribution:** Mentions ChatGPT, Claude, or Cursor
- **Contact:** Public email or Twitter in profile

---

## üìù Manual Search Process

### Step 1: Run Search on GitHub
1. Go to https://github.com/search
2. Paste one of the queries above
3. Filter by "Recently updated"
4. Look through first 20 results

### Step 2: Evaluate Each Project
Open the repo and check:
- [ ] Is it JavaScript/TypeScript?
- [ ] Has package.json?
- [ ] Less than 500 files?
- [ ] Individual owner (not org)?
- [ ] Active in last 3 months?
- [ ] Can contact owner?

### Step 3: Clone and Scan
For promising projects:
```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/username/project-name
cd project-name

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run VibeSec scan
vibesec scan . --explain -o scan-results.txt

# Or with our development version
bun run /home/f3rg/src/github/vibesec/cli/index.ts scan . --explain -o results.txt
```

### Step 4: Document Findings
Create a spreadsheet with:
- Project name & URL
- Owner GitHub username
- Owner contact (email/Twitter)
- Files scanned
- Critical issues found
- High issues found
- Security score
- Notable vulnerabilities
- Would owner make a good beta tester? (Y/N)

---

## üìä Data Collection Template

Create a file: `github-scan-results.csv`

```csv
Project Name,GitHub URL,Owner,Owner Contact,Files Scanned,Critical,High,Medium,Low,Score,Notable Issues,Good Tester?,Notes
MyApp,https://github.com/user/myapp,@username,user@email.com,42,3,5,2,1,45/100,"SQL injection, hardcoded secrets",Yes,Active developer
```

---

## üé¨ Scanning Workflow

### Quick Scan (5 min per project)

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# scan-project.sh

PROJECT_URL=$1
PROJECT_NAME=$(basename $PROJECT_URL .git)

# Clone
git clone $PROJECT_URL /tmp/$PROJECT_NAME
cd /tmp/$PROJECT_NAME

# Scan
vibesec scan . --explain > /tmp/${PROJECT_NAME}-scan.txt

# Show summary
echo "=== $PROJECT_NAME Scan Results ==="
cat /tmp/${PROJECT_NAME}-scan.txt | grep -A 5 "Security Score"
cat /tmp/${PROJECT_NAME}-scan.txt | grep "üö®\|‚ö†Ô∏è" | head -5

# Cleanup
cd -
rm -rf /tmp/$PROJECT_NAME
```

**Usage:**
```bash
bash scan-project.sh https://github.com/username/project
```

---

## üéØ Goal: Scan 20 Projects in 2 Hours

**Time Budget:**
- 5 min/project √ó 20 projects = 100 minutes
- 20 min for setup and documentation
- Total: 2 hours

**Target Findings:**
- At least 15 projects with security issues
- At least 10 projects with critical issues
- 3-5 interesting case studies
- 5-10 potential beta testers

---

## üìà Expected Statistics

Based on POC testing with `examples/`, we expect:

**Likely Findings:**
- ~70-80% of projects will have at least one issue
- ~40-50% will have critical issues (hardcoded secrets)
- ~60% will have SQL injection or XSS
- ~30% will have insecure CORS
- Average score: 60-75/100

**Article-Worthy Stats:**
- "X% of AI-generated projects have hardcoded API keys"
- "Average security score: XX/100"
- "Most common vulnerability: [SQL injection/secrets/etc]"
- "Typical fix time: XX hours total"

---

## üöÄ Specific GitHub Searches to Run NOW

Copy these into GitHub search (in order of priority):

### Priority 1: Claude Projects (Your Audience)
```
"built with Claude" language:TypeScript stars:0..20 pushed:>2024-09-01
```
**Expected:** 10-20 repos, high quality matches

### Priority 2: ChatGPT Side Projects
```
"generated by ChatGPT" language:JavaScript stars:0..10 pushed:>2024-10-01
```
**Expected:** 50+ repos, many side projects

### Priority 3: Cursor Users
```
"cursor" "ai" language:TypeScript created:>2024-08-01 stars:0..15
```
**Expected:** 20-30 repos, active developers

### Priority 4: AI SDK Users
```
"@anthropic/sdk" language:TypeScript pushed:>2024-09-01
```

## üí° Pro Tips

### Finding Contact Info
1. **Check GitHub profile** - Many have email/Twitter
2. **Check package.json** - Often has author email
3. **Check commits** - Git config email
4. **Check README** - Sometimes has contact section

### Avoiding Dead Ends
- Skip repos with just a README and no code
- Skip template repos (lots of stars, minimal custom code)
- Skip forks (test the original instead)
- Skip bots and automated repos

### Being Respectful
- Don't spam with issues on every repo
- Only contact 1-2 people per day initially
- Provide value (free security scan)
- Be genuine about wanting feedback

---

## üìù Next Steps After Scanning

### 1. Compile Statistics
```bash
# Count total projects scanned
# Calculate average security score
# List most common vulnerabilities
# Find most severe examples
```

### 2. Create Case Studies
Pick 3-5 interesting examples:
- **The Good:** High score (90+), show what secure looks like
- **The Bad:** Low score (40-60), common issues
- **The Ugly:** Critical issues (hardcoded production API keys)

### 3. Write the Article
Use template in next section

### 4. Reach Out to Owners
- Thank them for building in public
- Offer free security scan results
- Ask if they'd test VibeSec
