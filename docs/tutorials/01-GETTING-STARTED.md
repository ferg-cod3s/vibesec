‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ
Found hardcoded API key in source code

üìç Location: src/config/api.js:5
üí° Risk: API key exposure could lead to unauthorized access

const apiKey = "sk_live_abc123...";
               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Fix: Move to environment variables

### [03:30-04:15] Plain Language Mode (for non-technical users)

**Visual:** Terminal with --explain flag

**Narration:**
> "If you're not a developer, VibeSec has a special plain-language mode that explains security issues in everyday terms. Just add the --explain flag."

**Screen:**
```bash
$ vibesec scan . --explain

üîí Security Issues Found (Explained Simply)

Issue 1 of 5 - CRITICAL
‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê

What's wrong?
  Your code contains an API key written directly in the source code.
  Think of this like writing your house key on the front door.

Why does this matter?
  Anyone who sees your code (including on GitHub) can access your
  services and rack up charges or steal data.

How do I fix it?
  Move the API key to a .env file and use environment variables.
  Any developer on your team can help with this - it takes about
  15 minutes.

Who should fix this?
  Any developer

How urgent is this?
  üö® CRITICAL - Fix before deploying
```

**Text overlay:** "Perfect for PMs, designers, and non-technical team members!"
