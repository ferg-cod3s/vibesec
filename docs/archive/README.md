## Why GitHub Projects?

According to `/CLAUDE.md` global development standards:

> **Use GitHub Projects for all planning instead of .md files:**
>
> - `gh project create` for new projects
> - `gh project item-add` for adding tasks
> - Automatic progress tracking via linked issues/PRs
> - Better collaboration and visibility
> - No manual .md file maintenance

### Benefits of the Migration

1. **Real-Time Collaboration:** Team members can see live updates
2. **Linked Progress:** Issues and PRs automatically update project status
3. **Better Filtering:** Filter by milestone, assignee, labels, status
4. **Automation:** GitHub Actions can update project items automatically
5. **Visibility:** Public project board for community contributors
