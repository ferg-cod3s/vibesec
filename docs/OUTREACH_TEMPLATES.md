# VibeSec Outreach Templates

**Purpose:** Ready-to-use templates for reaching out to beta testers

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-10

---

## üê¶ Twitter/X Templates

### Template 1: Initial Announcement Tweet

```
üöÄ I scanned 20 AI-generated projects for security issues

Results:
‚Ä¢ X% had critical vulnerabilities
‚Ä¢ Most common: Hardcoded API keys (Y%)
‚Ä¢ Avg security score: Z/100

Built VibeSec to fix this - explains issues in plain language

Looking for 5 beta testers! üôã

[Thread üëá]
```

**Thread Continuation:**
```
2/ The problem: AI tools (Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor) are amazing
for speed, but they often generate insecure code

Common issues I found:
‚Ä¢ SQL injection in login forms
‚Ä¢ Hardcoded production secrets
‚Ä¢ Missing input validation

Most devs don't notice until it's too late
```

```
3/ Example: Found a project with:

const apiKey = "sk_live_abc123..."

That's a $10K/month Stripe key... in the repo...
committed to GitHub... üò¨

The dev had no idea
```

```
4/ So I built VibeSec - security scanner that:
‚úÖ Finds issues in AI-generated code
‚úÖ Explains in plain language (no jargon!)
‚úÖ Shows security score (0-100)
‚úÖ Works for non-technical users

Example:
vibesec scan --explain
‚Üí "This is like leaving your door unlocked"
```

```
5/ Looking for 5 beta testers to try it on their projects

Ideal if you:
‚Ä¢ Built something with Claude/ChatGPT/Cursor
‚Ä¢ Have a JavaScript/TypeScript codebase
‚Ä¢ Want a free security scan + feedback

Reply/DM if interested!

[Link to Quick Start]
```

### Template 2: Direct Outreach DM

**Subject:** Quick security scan for [PROJECT_NAME]?

```
Hey! üëã

Saw you built [PROJECT_NAME] with [ChatGPT/Claude/Cursor] -
looks cool!

I'm building VibeSec - a security scanner specifically for
AI-generated code. It explains issues in plain language
(no security expertise needed).

Would you be interested in:
1. Free security scan of your project
2. 10-min beta test + feedback
3. Help fixing any issues we find

Example output: "This is like leaving your door unlocked"
instead of "CWE-798: Hardcoded credentials"

Lmk if interested!

- [Your name]

P.S. Quick start: [link if they want to try themselves]
```

### Template 3: Follow-Up After Article

**After publishing the article:**

```
üìù New post: "I Scanned 20 AI-Generated Projects. Here's What I Found"

Key findings:
‚Ä¢ X% had critical security issues
‚Ä¢ AI tools are fast but risky
‚Ä¢ Most devs don't know about these vulnerabilities

Built VibeSec to help fix this üõ°Ô∏è

Read: [link]

Looking for beta testers! Reply if interested üëá
```

### Template 4: Engagement Tweet

**To start conversations:**

```
Hot take: AI coding tools are making us ship FASTER but
not SAFER

ChatGPT/Claude/Cursor generate perfectly functional code
with critical security flaws

Scanned 20 projects:
- 73% had hardcoded secrets
- 45% had SQL injection
- 89% had ‚â•1 critical issue

We need better tools for this
```

### Template 5: Value-First Approach

```
Free offer: I'll scan your AI-generated project for
security issues (using VibeSec)

You get:
‚úÖ Full security report
‚úÖ Security score (0-100)
‚úÖ Plain language explanations
‚úÖ Help fixing issues

I get:
‚úÖ Real-world testing
‚úÖ Your feedback

First 10 replies. Go! üëá
```

### Template 3: Pull Request Comment

**Scenario:** After they merge a PR with security issues

**Comment:**
```markdown
Hey @username! üëã

I noticed this PR introduced some code that might have security
concerns. I ran VibeSec on it and found:

### üö® Critical Issue
**Hardcoded API Key** in `src/config.ts:15`

```typescript
const apiKey = "sk_live_abc123"; // ‚ö†Ô∏è Should use process.env.API_KEY
```

**Risk:** If this repo is public (or becomes public), this key
is compromised

**Fix:** (2 minutes)
```typescript
const apiKey = process.env.API_KEY;
```

Then add to `.env`:
```
API_KEY=sk_live_abc123
```

And `.gitignore`:
```
.env
```

## üéØ Reddit Templates

### Template 1: r/SideProject Post

**Title:** [ShowOff] VibeSec - Security scanner for AI-generated code

**Body:**
```markdown
## What I Built

VibeSec - a security scanner specifically designed for code
generated by AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude, Cursor, etc.)

## The Problem

I scanned 20 AI-generated projects and found:
- 73% had critical security issues
- Most common: Hardcoded API keys (leaked to GitHub)
- Average security score: 62/100
- Devs had no idea these issues existed

AI tools are amazing for speed, but they generate insecure code.

## The Solution

VibeSec explains security issues in plain language:

**Before (traditional scanners):**
"CWE-798: Use of hard-coded credentials detected"

**After (VibeSec):**
"üö® API key written directly in code (config.js:9)
Think of this like writing your password on a sticky note.
Anyone with code access can steal it. Fix time: 10-15 min"

## Features

‚úÖ Security score (0-100) with letter grades
‚úÖ Plain language explanations (no jargon)
‚úÖ Stakeholder reports (for showing your boss)
‚úÖ Accessibility (screen reader compatible)
‚úÖ Works for non-technical users

## Tech Stack

TypeScript + Bun runtime
AST analysis for vulnerability detection
19 security rules (more coming)

## Try It

```bash
npm install -g vibesec
vibesec scan --explain
```

[Quick Start Guide](link)

## Looking for Beta Testers!

If you're building with AI and want a free security scan,
comment below or DM me!

## Demo

Feedback welcome! üôè
```

### Template 2: r/ChatGPT Comment

**On posts about AI-generated code:**

```
Built with ChatGPT? Make sure to run a security scan!

I scanned 20 ChatGPT-generated projects and 73% had critical
issues (hardcoded API keys, SQL injection, etc.)

Made VibeSec to help with this - explains security in plain
language:

vibesec scan --explain

Example:
"This is like leaving your front door unlocked" instead of
"CWE-89: SQL Injection vulnerability"

Free + open source. Happy to scan your project if interested!
```

## üìä LinkedIn Templates

### Template 1: LinkedIn Post

```
üö® I scanned 20 AI-generated projects for security issues

The results surprised me:

‚Ä¢ 73% had critical vulnerabilities
‚Ä¢ 89% had at least one security issue
‚Ä¢ Average security score: 62/100
‚Ä¢ Most common: Hardcoded production secrets

AI coding tools (ChatGPT, Claude, Cursor) are incredible for
productivity. But they often generate insecure code.

Example: Found production Stripe API keys hardcoded in repos.
One was processing $10K/month. Exposed on GitHub.

So I built VibeSec - a security scanner that:
‚úÖ Finds issues in AI-generated code
‚úÖ Explains in business language (not jargon)
‚úÖ Provides fix time estimates
‚úÖ Works for non-technical users

For PMs, designers, and founders building with AI.

Try it: npm install -g vibesec

Looking for beta testers! DM if you're building with AI.
