## Design Patterns for Accessible CLIs

### Pattern 1: Smart Defaults
**Principle:** Tool works without any flags

**Bad:**
```bash
vibesec scan --path . --output console --format text --severity all
```

**Good:**
```bash
vibesec  # Scans current dir, shows text summary
```

**Implementation:**
```python
@click.command()
@click.argument('path', default='.')
@click.option('--show', default='summary')
def scan(path, show):
    # All defaults are sensible
    pass
```

---

### Pattern 2: Conversational Flags
**Principle:** Use plain language, not abbreviations

**Bad:**
```bash
vibesec scan -p ./src -o json -s high
```

**Good:**
```bash
vibesec scan --where ./src --show file --explain
```

**Implementation:**
```python
@click.option('--where', help='Which folder to scan?')
@click.option('--show', help='How to show results?')
@click.option('--explain', help='Use simple language')
```

---

### Pattern 3: Progressive Disclosure
**Principle:** Simple by default, detailed when needed

**Implementation:**
```bash
vibesec                # Simple summary
vibesec --show detailed  # Technical details
vibesec --help         # All options
```

---

### Pattern 4: Visual Feedback
**Principle:** Show progress and celebrate success

**Implementation:**
```python
from rich.progress import Progress

with Progress() as progress:
    task = progress.add_task("Scanning...", total=100)
    # ... do work ...
    progress.update(task, advance=50)

# Success message
console.print("\n✅ [bold green]Scan Complete![/bold green]")
console.print(f"📊 Scanned {count} files")
```

---

### Pattern 5: Helpful Examples
**Principle:** Show, don't just tell

**Implementation:**
```python
@click.command()
def scan():
    """
    Scan your code for security issues.

    Examples:
        vibesec scan              # Scan current directory
        vibesec scan ./myapp      # Scan specific folder
        vibesec scan --explain    # Use plain language
    """
```

---

### Pattern 6: Interactive Mode
**Principle:** Guide users with questions

**Implementation:**
```python
import questionary

def interactive_setup():
    """Guide users through first scan."""

    path = questionary.path(
        "Where is your project?",
        default="."
    ).ask()

    output = questionary.select(
        "How would you like to see results?",
        choices=[
            "Simple summary (recommended)",
            "Technical details",
            "Save to file"
        ]
    ).ask()

    run_scan(path, output)
```

## Plain Language Translation Guide

### Security Terms → Business Language

| Technical Term | Plain Language | Analogy |
|---------------|----------------|---------|
| SQL Injection | Unsafe database query | Unlocked front door |
| XSS | Unsafe user input display | Poisoned water supply |
| Hardcoded secrets | Password in code | Sticky note on monitor |
| CSRF | Missing request verification | Forged signature |
| Vulnerable dependency | Outdated package with holes | Lock that can be picked |
| Command injection | Unsafe system command | Blank check to stranger |
| Path traversal | Unrestricted file access | Skeleton key |
| Insecure deserialization | Unsafe data unpacking | Trojan horse package |

---

### Severity Levels → Business Impact

| Technical | Plain Language | Business Impact |
|-----------|----------------|-----------------|
| CRITICAL | 🚨 Urgent - Fix Today | High risk of data breach, legal liability |
| HIGH | ⚠️ Important - Fix This Week | Moderate risk to data security, user trust |
| MEDIUM | 📋 Notable - Fix Soon | Could lead to security problems |
| LOW | ℹ️ Good to Know | Minimal risk, best practices |

### Example Transformations

#### Example 1: SQL Injection

**Technical:**
```
CVE-2023-XXXX: SQL Injection vulnerability in database.py:45
Pattern: f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = {user_id}"
CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements
OWASP A03:2021 - Injection
```

**Plain Language:**
```
🚨 Urgent - Fix Today

Found: Unsafe database query in database.py:45

What this means:
Your code builds database queries by combining text with user input.

Why it matters:
An attacker could type special characters to trick your database into
running their commands instead of yours. They could:
- Steal all your user data
- Delete your entire database
- Access other people's accounts

Real-world example:
Instead of typing "123" for their ID, an attacker could type:
  123 OR 1=1
This would return ALL users instead of just one.

How to fix:
Use parameterized queries (prepared statements):

Before:
  query = f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = {user_id}"

After:
  cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = %s", (user_id,))

Time needed: 15-30 minutes
Who can fix: Any backend developer

#### Example 2: Hardcoded Secret

**Technical:**
```
Secret detected: API key in config.py:23
Pattern: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY = "sk-ant-..."
Severity: CRITICAL
CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials
```

**Plain Language:**
```
🚨 Urgent - Fix Today

Found: API key written directly in code (config.py:23)

What this means:
Someone saved an API key right in your code file. This is like writing
your credit card number on a public bulletin board.

Why it matters:
- If this code is on GitHub, anyone can see and use your API key
- Former employees could still have access
- You'll get charged for other people's usage
- The key can't be changed without updating your code

What could happen:
- $1000s in unexpected API bills
- Your account gets banned for abuse
- Sensitive data accessed by strangers

How to fix:
1. Move the key to an environment variable
2. Add .env to .gitignore
3. Change the API key immediately (old one is compromised)
4. Set up billing alerts

Before:
  ANTHROPIC_API_KEY = "sk-ant-abc123..."

After:
  import os
  ANTHROPIC_API_KEY = os.environ.get('ANTHROPIC_API_KEY')

Time needed: 10-15 minutes
Who can fix: Any developer
