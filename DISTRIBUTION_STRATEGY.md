---

## Key Success Factors

1. **Real Examples**: Show actual vulnerabilities caught, not theoretical
2. **Easy Setup**: < 2 minutes from zero to scanning
3. **Clear Value**: Quantify impact (saved time, prevented breaches)
4. **Community**: Build Discord, engage with users
5. **Content**: Weekly content showing VibeSec in action

---

## Competitive Advantage

- âœ… Built for AI coding workflows (not legacy code)
- âœ… Catches AI-specific vulnerabilities (prompt injection, incomplete impl)
- âœ… MCP integration (works IN your AI assistant)
- âœ… Real-time scanning (not batch jobs)
- âœ… Developer-first (not security team-first)

---

## Next Actions (Right Now)

1. [ ] Restart Claude Code to activate VibeSec
