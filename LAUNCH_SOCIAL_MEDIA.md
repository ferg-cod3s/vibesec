### Main Post (Platform-Native)

🔐 **Introducing VibeSec: Security for the Age of AI-Generated Code**

I just shipped something I've been thinking about for months: a security scanner built specifically for code generated by Claude, Cursor, and Copilot.

Here's the problem: 45% of AI-generated code fails security tests (Veracode 2025). SQL injection, hardcoded secrets, incomplete implementations - patterns that human developers would catch immediately, but AI assistants frequently miss.

So I built **VibeSec** - an open-source security scanner that integrates directly into Claude Code, Cursor, and Cline through MCP.

Instead of a separate tool, VibeSec works INSIDE your workflow. Just ask Claude: "Scan this file for security issues" and it detects:

✅ Hardcoded API keys & credentials  
✅ SQL injection vulnerabilities  
✅ Command injection risks  
✅ Incomplete implementations (TODOs left in code)  
✅ Weak authentication patterns  
✅ AI-specific vulnerabilities

**The best part:** 2-minute setup, runs 100% locally, completely free.

Open source on GitHub: github.com/ferg-cod3s/vibesec

This solves a real problem for any team shipping AI-assisted code. If you're using Claude/Cursor at work, you should try this.

## X/Twitter Posts

### Post 1: Main Announcement (RECOMMENDED TO POST FIRST)

Just shipped VibeSec 🔐 - a security scanner built for AI-generated code that works inside Claude, Cursor & Cline via MCP.

45% of AI code fails security tests. VibeSec catches what your AI assistant missed: SQL injection, hardcoded secrets, incomplete implementations & more.

Open source & free: github.com/ferg-cod3s/vibesec

---

### Post 2: Problem Hook

Your AI assistant just generated perfect-looking code. You deployed it. Your security team found a SQL injection vulnerability.

This is why I built VibeSec 🔐 - a scanner that works INSIDE Claude/Cursor to catch vulnerabilities AI assistants miss.

Open source. Free. Local only.

### Post 3: Feature Highlight - MCP Integration

The best part about VibeSec?

You don't need a new tool. Just ask Claude: "Scan this file for security issues using VibeSec"

It works as an MCP tool inside your existing workflow. Zero friction. Maximum value.

### Post 5: Developer Call-to-Action

If you use Claude/Cursor to write code, try VibeSec.

It catches:

- Hardcoded API keys
- SQL injection
- Command injection
- Weak auth patterns

### Post 6: Community/Contribution

VibeSec is live on GitHub! 🚀

We're looking for:

- Detection rule contributions
- Platform-specific integrations
- Bug reports & feedback
- Language expansions (Python, Go, Rust)

Join us in securing AI-generated code.

Star ⭐ if you believe in this:

## Twitter Thread (7 Tweets)

### Tweet 1 (Opener)

"I just shipped something I've been thinking about for months.

45% of AI-generated code fails security tests. Most developers using Claude/Cursor don't have tooling for this.

So I built VibeSec 🧵"

### Tweet 2

"The problem:

- AI code looks perfect but has SQL injection
- Hardcoded API keys in config files
- Complete auth implementations left as TODOs
- Command injection vulnerabilities

Patterns that experienced devs catch instantly. AI assistants? They miss them."

### Tweet 3

"VibeSec works INSIDE your workflow.

Instead of running a separate security tool:

You just ask Claude: 'Can you scan this file for security issues using VibeSec?'

Claude invokes the tool, finds vulnerabilities, and explains fixes."

### Tweet 4

"What VibeSec detects:
✅ Hardcoded credentials (API keys, passwords, tokens)
✅ SQL injection vulnerabilities
✅ Command injection risks  
✅ Incomplete implementations
✅ Weak auth patterns
✅ XSS vulnerabilities
✅ And 14+ more patterns"

### Tweet 5

"Setup takes 2 minutes:

- Clone repo
- Add to ~/.claude/mcp.json
- Restart Claude Code
- Done

Works with:

- Claude Code ✓
- Cursor ✓
- Cline ✓
- CLI ✓"

### Tweet 6

"Best part?
💰 Completely free
🔓 Open source (MIT)
🖥️ 100% local - code never leaves your machine
⚡ Fast (3000+ lines/sec)
✅ Accurate (<2% false positives)"

### Tweet 7

"Available today on GitHub:
github.com/ferg-cod3s/vibesec

Try it on your own code. Tell me what vulnerabilities it finds. Join us in securing the age of AI-assisted development.

⭐ If you find this useful!"
